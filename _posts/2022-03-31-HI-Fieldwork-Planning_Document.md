This post describes the timeline and methodology for all work planned during the 2022 Hawaii field season (May 3 - 24, 2022). Four *or five* studies will be undertaken during this trip. A short description of each will be provided below. More information can be found on the fieldwork [Project Planning Board](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wk-LZTC3IodZK4Fl0aom9ScmrV3Sp7WyebNt9Eip_JA/edit?usp=sharing) and [Gannt chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c775d3092MQPRe_A6MTZHt1ST8cilzxIEh20Iktq_jE/edit?usp=sharing) made by Dr. Tim Stephens.

### Study 1: Pacu ploidy and stress response


### Study 2: Pacu and Mcap regional population structure and connectivity


### Study 3: Coral Microbiome Biogeography across colonies and reefs


#### Sampling Plan (Fig. 1):  
To characterize microbiome biogeography of *Montipora capitata* in O’ahu, Hawai’i, we will sample **coral tissue (n=3)** from three regions on the coral colony: the tips, mid-region, and base. **Coral colonies (n=3 reef-1)** will be sampled from **10 reefs** around the island of O’ahu to assess geographic variability in microbiome composition. We will additionally collect **water (n=3)** and **sediment (as appropriate; n=3)** samples from the vicinity of each colony for use as controls. All **450 samples (270 coral, 90 water, 90 sediment)** will be processed using 16S rRNA sequencing to identify microbial community composition.

##### Coral microbiome sampling and processing

##### Water microbiome sampling and processing

Follow seawater collection methods described [here](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0229442#sec002). In short, each seawater sample is collected using a 60 mL syringes attached to a filter holder each containing a 0.22 μm pore size Supor® filter (Pall Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). Syringes will be stored in sterile Whirl-pack® bags prior to sampling.

##### Sediment microbiome sampling and processing

### Study 4: Antibody stress tests


### *Study 5: Karyotyping (to be conducted by Richmond Lab during spawning season?)*
