**Extraction Notes**
- Gathered all samples and set aside on ice. Then added DNA/RNA Shield to all.
- Tube for sample 156 was labelled "161" on side label but "156" on top label.
- Digested for 3 hours and 5 minutes at 55°C
- All samples except for 166 had very high lipids.
- After digestion, pelleted out lipids in all samples. Centrifuged at 2200 rcf for 1 min.
