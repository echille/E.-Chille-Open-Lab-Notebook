#### Extraction Date: April 12, 2019
**Samples**

|Extraction #|Sample #|Date Collected|Quantity (µL)|Extracter|
|------------|-----|-------|------|------|
|31|360|6/22/2018||Erin|
|32|364|6/22/2018||Erin|

**Extraction Notes**
- Gathered all samples and set aside on ice. Then added DNA/RNA Shield to all.
- Digested for 3 hours and 10 minutes at 55°C
- Some larvae did not appear to digest but liquid was dark yellow
- After digestion, pelleted out additional tissue in all samples. Centrifuged at 1600 rcf for 1 min.
- Added additional 15 µL of DNase I (without the buffer) to RNA sample 360.

**Qubit**  
*Quantified on April 18, 2019*  
- Followed Broad Range dsDNA and RNA Qubit [protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Qubit-Protocol/)
- All samples were read twice
