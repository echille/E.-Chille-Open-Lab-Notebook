**Extraction Notes**
- Gathered all samples and set aside on ice. Then added DNA/RNA Shield to all.
- Digested for 2 hours and 12 minutes at 55°C
- All samples except for 166 had very high lipids.
- After digestion, pelleted out lipids in all samples. Centrifuged at 2200 rcf for 1 min.
- Dropped sample #169 after adding EtOH (Step 2 RNA Extraction). Spilled about 1/2 of sample.
