### Hello and welcome to my open lab notebook!

I am a Master's student at the University of Rhode Island studying the embryogenesis of the Pacific rice coral, Montipora capitata, and the effects of ocean acidification on its embryonic development on a molecular level. I am skilled in science communication, RNA/DNA extractions, scientific diving, microscopy, bioinformatics, and coral aquaculture.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

I will be graduating with a M.S. in Evolutionary and Marine Biology in May 2021, and am planning on entering into a Ph.D. program in the Fall of 2021. My research interests are primarily focused on investigating the mechanisms that allow reef-building corals to adapt and acclimatize to multiple simultaneous stressors, and the implications of these mechanisms towards conservation and ecology. 

See my current projects on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Erin_Chille)!
