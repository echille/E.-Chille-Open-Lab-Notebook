###About:

I am an undergraduate Marine Biology major minoring in Restoration Science and Management at the University of Rhode Island. In addition to my studies, I am a member of the Putnam Lab and am Chief Watchstander at the Inner Space Center in Narragansett, Rhode Island. My research interests are focused on how organisms that live on the threshold of their physiological limits will respond to climate change. More specifically, I am interested in the thermal tolerance of corals and their abilities to adapt and acclimatize to changing environmental conditions. My long-term goal is to become a researcher, using my studies to support reef conservation efforts.

##### **Study Abroad**
**CSI Oceans R/V Endeavor Cruise,** *Northwest Atlantic Coast (1 week)* &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;*Apr 2018,* Investigated right whale-zooplankton-environment interactions offshore of Rhode Island. Prepared and conducted live telepresence interactions with the public (schools, organizations) from the ship that outlined shipboard activities, relevant science background material, and cruise discoveries [(link)](https://youtu.be/MeYmJqoSRdg).

**Bermuda Marine Biodiversity,** *Bermuda (1 week)* &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;*Mar 2017,* Used GoPro video footage to investigate the effects of wave exposure on species composition and biodiversity in the benthic community. &nbsp;

**Coral Reef Conservation,** *Bonaire, Dutch Antilles (2 weeks)* &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;*Jan 2016,* Learned about coral reef ecology, major anthropogenic effects on coral reefs, and potential management solutions for reef restoration. Collected and analyzed underwater data on reef health using fish counts, reef rugosity measurements, and point-intercept benthic composition surveys, and used this information to investigate the effectiveness of Marine Protected Areas. &nbsp;

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

### **Relevant Experience:**

**Undergraduate Research Assistant,** *P.I. Dr. Graham Forrester* &nbsp;
*Jun 2018–Pres,* Investigating the effects of parasitism and refuge shortage on density-dependent interactions in bridled gobies. Research conducted on Guana Island, British Virgin Islands. Paper to be published. &nbsp;
*Sept 2016–Dec 2017,* Organized data collected during the URI Bonaire J-term Program from 2014-2017 in order to compile a status report for the STINAPA Bonaire National Parks Foundation. 

**Undergraduate Research Assistant,** *P.I. Dr. Hollie Putnam* &nbsp;
*Jan 2018-Pres,* Investigating the effects of thermal stress on coral larvae fitness using chlorophyll analysis, cell counts and BCA protein assay protocols.

**Chief Watchstander** *Inner Space Center, Narragansett, RI* &nbsp;
*Jul 2017-Sept 2018* Recruit, train, and manage undergraduate interns, as well as schedulewatchstander and engineer shifts during telepresence-enabled research expeditions. Act as a ship to shore liaison for scientists onboard the NOAA Ship Okeanos Explorer, E/V Nautilus and UNOLS vessels by logging scientific data. Manage watchstander projects such as educational content development and videodata storage inventories.

**Lab Technician,** *URI Watershed Watch, Kingston, RI* &nbsp;
*May 2017-Feb 2018,* Processed water samples from over 30 sites monthly for dissolved oxygen, pH and alkalinity, chlorophyll, and nutrient analysis, and managed associated data. Sterilized, washed, and prepared glassware for monthly collections.

**Undergraduate Research Fellow,** *URI Watershed Watch, Advisors: Linda Green and Elizabeth Herron* &nbsp;
*May-Dec 2017,* Developed monitoring and analytical protocols for the collection and size
fractionation of cyanobacteria. Examined the efficacy of using cyanobacteria fractionation to predict bloom formation. Conducted fluorometric analysis on over 100 samples from three ponds to determine chlorophyll and phycocyanin concentration. Analyzed data and summarized study in a scientific poster.

**Watchstander** *Inner Space Center, Narragansett, RI* &nbsp;
*Jun 2016-Jul 2017* Act as a ship to shore liaison for scientists onboard the NOAA Ship Okeanos Explorer, E/V Nautilus and UNOLS vessels by logging scientific data. Write content for and maintain Inner Space Center and Discovery of Sound in the Sea websites, such as documenting dive highlights, new discoveries, events. Research and develop oceanographic projects, such as NOAA’s Ocean Video Lab Citizen Science Project. Manage databases and inventories using Google Sheets.
