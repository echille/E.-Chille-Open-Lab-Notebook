I am an undergraduate Marine Biology major minoring in Restoration Science and Management at the University of Rhode Island. In addition to my studies, I am a member of the Putnam Lab and am Chief Watchstander at the Inner Space Center in Narragansett, Rhode Island. My research interests are focused on how organisms that live on the threshold of their physiological limits will respond to climate change. More specifically, I am interested in the thermal tolerance of corals and their abilities to adapt and acclimatize to changing environmental conditions. My long-term goal is to become a researcher, using my studies to support reef conservation efforts.
