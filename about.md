### About Me

I am a Master's student in the [Putnam Lab](https://putnamlab.com) studying the early development of the Pacific rice coral, *Montipora capitata* on a transcriptomic level, focusing on maternal provisioning, the maternal-to-zygotic transition, and effects of ocean acidification. I am skilled in science communication, DNA/RNA extractions, scientific diving, microscopy, bioinformatics, and coral culturing. In my free time, I enjoy partner-dancing, exploring the great outdoors, and watching sit-coms (especially *The Office*).

I will be graduating with an M.S. in Evolutionary and Marine Biology in May 2021, and am planning on entering into a Ph.D. program in the Fall of 2021. My research interests are primarily focused on using multi-omics and systems biology to investigate how reef-building corals respond to multiple simultaneous stressors, with implications towards conservation and ecology.
